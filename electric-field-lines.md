## The Superposition Principle. 

We know the electric field of a point charge but what about a configuration where there are many point charges? 

Just like we add forces to find the net force. We must add electric field to find the net electric field. This is the principle of superposition.

Read carefully section 23.2 and do example 23.1. Make note on how one needs to add the electric field as vectors.

## Four models for electric field. 

In the image below, you can see the four most important models we will use for electric charge. Next week we will learn how to derive these expressions and many more.
