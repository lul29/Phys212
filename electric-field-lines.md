## The Superposition Principle. 

We know the electric field of a point charge but what about a configuration where there are many point charges? 

You just need to add their electric field. 





## Four models for electric field. 

In the image below, you can see the four most important models we will use for electric charge. Next week we will learn how to derive these expressions and many more.
