</stop-note>

We start our study of induction by looking at a situation where the magnetic field is not even changing. 

Read particularly carefully section 30.2 which talks about motional EMF. For the moment the B Field is not changing, the idea is that a moving conductor inside of B field will develop a voltage difference because the charges inside the conductor will feel a force and move. 

You can think of this moving conductor has being a battery with an induced EMF 

<lrn-math>\mathcal{E} = vlB </lrn-math>

derived by using the magnetic force on moving charges and integrating the resulting E field to find the voltage. (see review section). 

If you close the loop, you would get not just an induced EMF, you would also get an induced current. 

Example 30.1-30.3 are all very interesting to work through. 

### Eddy current. 

We do not have the tools to analyse this quantitatively but the idea...
