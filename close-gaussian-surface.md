## Closed Gaussian Surface

If the electric field is not constant over the whole area, we calculate the flux for small pieces and add them all together. This become an integral. 

<lrn-math> \Phi_e= \int \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} </lrn-math>

Finally we have a special symbol if the surface is closed 

<lrn-math> \Phi_e = \oint \vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A} </lrn-math>

just because we like to be cool and define specially nice looking symbol to impress our friends!

The surface integral are hard to do in general and left for later math course. In this course, we will not need to perform these integrals in details.

## Gauss's Law

Finally the statement of Gauss law is 

<lrn-math> \Phi_e =\oint \vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{Q_{in}}{\epsilon_0} </lrn-math>
