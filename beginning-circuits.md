Ok we are now ready to put all the things together and apply them to circuits. The book starts nicely by first introducing the battery and the the capacitor. Not many examples or problems here in this section. 

This section introduces the first two circuits concepts, the emf (pronounce e-m-f) of a battery and the capacitance of capacitor.

EMF: This stands for electromotive force. Essentially it is a measure of the work (energy) per unit of charge that a particular source can do. The nature of the process depends on the source and typical battery use chemical reactions to move positive ions. But later in this course, we will create emf using magnetic fields. For a typical battery, the emf of the battery is nearly the same as the voltage of the battery. For an ideal battery, it is the same.

You should assume ideal batteries in all physics problems unless otherwise specified.  In the video below I create an extremely non-ideal battery.
