## Reading guide Chap 25

This chapter introduces the idea of electric potential. This is the idea of  voltage something that everyone knows a little bit from daily experience.

The potential energy due to the electric force comes from integrating the force. Two of the most typical cases for electric force are 

 * near an infinite plane (or inside a parallel plate capacitor). The electric field and force are constant so the potential is just <lrn-math>\Delta U = eE\Delta s </lrn-math>
 * for point charges. The potential energy is <lrn-math> U=\frac{Kq_1q_2}{r} </lrn-math>. This the potential energy between each pair of charges.

Â These formulas are very similar to what we had with gravity.  Near the Earth where the force of gravity is nearly constant <lrn-math> \Delta U_G=mg\Delta y</lrn-math> or in space <lrn-math>U_G=-\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r}</lrn-math>. The main difference with electricity is again the possible sign of the charges. The protons and electrons move in opposite direction to decrease their energy. It is if some special particle would want to move up from the Earth!

Do carefully example 25.2, 25.3 and 25.4. Note that when there are multiple point charges, you should not double count!

Section 25.3 is important to read but less crucial then the rest of this chapter. 

Then in section 25.4, we introduce the idea of potential. There is an important analogy here.

The connection between potential and electric field will be studied more next week. It comes, as you can guess, from the deep conceptual connection between forces and energy.
