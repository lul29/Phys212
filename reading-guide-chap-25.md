## Reading guide Chap 25

This chapter introduces the idea of electric potential. This is the idea of  voltage something that everyone knows a little bit from daily experience.

The potential energy due to the electric force comes from integrating the force. Two of the most typical cases for electric forces are 

 * near an infinite plane (or inside a parallel plate capacitor). The electric field and force are constant so the potential is just <lrn-math>\Delta U = eE\Delta s </lrn-math>
 * for point charges. The potential energy is <lrn-math> U=\frac{Kq_1q_2}{r} </lrn-math>. This the potential energy between each pair of charges.

Â These formulas are very similar to what we had with gravity.  Near the Earth where the force of gravity is nearly constant <lrn-math> \Delta U_G=mg\Delta y</lrn-math> while in space <lrn-math>U_G=-\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r}</lrn-math>. The main difference with electricity is the possible sign difference of the charges. The protons and electrons move in opposite directions to decrease their energy. It is as if some special particle would want to move up from the Earth!

Do carefully examples (before looking at solutions) 25.2, 25.3 and 25.4. Note that when there are multiple point charges, you should not double count!

Section 25.3 about the energy of a dipole is important to read but less crucial than the rest of this chapter. 

Then in section 25.-6, we introduce the idea of potential and applied in more details to the two main cases, the capacitor, and point charge. There is an important analogy with the concept of electric potential

The connection between potential and electric field will be studied more next week. It comes, as you can guess, from the deep conceptual connection between force and energy.

Problem solving strategy 25.1 is just energy conservation applied to our context of electricity. Note that we will almost never have thermal energy loss since we will often deal with small particles.

Examples 25.6-25.8 are all great example of applying conservation of energy to electric situations.

The one thing confusing with the concept of potential (V) is the following. Both electrons and protons always move in the direction of **decreasing** potential energy (unless external work is done on them). As we have stated, these are opposite direction in space but still both decrease their energy. When we use the potential, we divide by the charge. The result is that now **protons move to decrease their V, while electrons move to increase their V**. The electron increase their potential in order to decrease their potential energy. (multiplying by negative charge).
