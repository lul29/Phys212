## Reading guide Chap 25

This chapter introduces the idea of electric potential. This is the idea of  voltage something that everyone knows a little bit from daily experience.

The potential energy due to the electric force comes from integrating the force over distance. Two of the most typical cases for electric forces are 

 * near an infinite plane (or inside a parallel plate capacitor). The electric field and force are constant so the potential is just force times distance <lrn-math>\Delta U = eE\Delta s </lrn-math>
 * for point charges. The potential energy is <lrn-math> U=\frac{Kq_1q_2}{r} </lrn-math>. This is the potential energy between each pair of charges. The eye often gloss over but remember this is 1/r NOT 1/r^2. And this is NOT a vector. So two important differences from what the electric field was.

 These formulas are very similar to what we had with gravity.  Near the Earth where the force of gravity is nearly constant <lrn-math> \Delta U_G=mg\Delta y</lrn-math> while in space <lrn-math>U_G=-\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r}</lrn-math>. The main difference with electricity is the possible sign difference of the charges. The protons and electrons move in opposite directions to decrease their energy. It is as if some special particle would want to move up from the Earth!

Do carefully examples (before looking at solutions) 25.2, 25.3 and 25.4. Note that when there are multiple point charges, you should not double count!

Section 25.3 about the energy of a dipole is important to read but less crucial than the rest of this chapter. 

Then in section 25.4-6, we introduce the idea of potential (V) not to be confused with potential energy U.  We then apply it in more details to the two main cases above, the capacitor, and point charge. There is an important analogy with the concept of electric potential

The connection between potential and electric field will be studied more next week. It comes, as you can guess, from the deep conceptual connection between force and energy.

Problem solving strategy 25.1 is just energy conservation applied to our context of electricity. Note that we will almost never have thermal energy loss in Phys 212 since we will almost always deal with small particles moving in vacuum where drag and friction do not matter. 

Examples 25.6-25.8 are all great examples of applying conservation of energy to electric situations.

The one thing confusing with the concept of potential (V) is the following. Both electrons and protons always move in the direction of <b>decreasing</b> potential energy (unless external work is done on them). As we have stated, these are opposite directions in space but still both decrease their energy. When we use the concept of potential, we divide by the charge. The result is that now <b>protons move to decrease their V, while electrons move to increase their V</b>. The electrons increase their potential in order to decrease their potential energy. (multiplying by negative charge).

We will use multiple ways to visualize the potential. I like contour map the best and then I need to remember that electrons want to go up mountains!

Finally section 25.7 is the electric point charge of multiple charges. Like the electric field, the electric potential can be obtained by adding the contributions from all the charges. For a continuous distribution of charges, this is an integral. 

<lrndesign-sidenote label="Instructor Note" icon="bookmark" bg-color="#c2e5f2">
Integral of V are easier than the electric field because the voltage is a scalar. There is no direction, no <lrn-math>\hat r </lrn-math>.
