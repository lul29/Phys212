## Ampere's law

Let us compare two laws of E&M that we have seen.

1) Ampere's law is

<lrn-math>\oint \vec{B}\cdot d\vec{l} = \mu_0 I_{through} </lrn-math>

2) Faraday's law (written in terms of E field instead of potential) is

<lrn-math> \oint \vec{E}\cdot d\vec{l} = -\frac{d\Phi_m}{dt} </lrn-math>


Remember that 

* The "amperian" path, the curve in the line integral,  is an arbitrary closed curve. You can choose it however you want. This is true in both Faraday's law and Ampere's. You choose the curve to evaluate the integral.
* The current in the right hand side of Ampere's law has to pierce through the surface delimited by the closed curve.
* Similarly the magnetic flux on the right hand side of Faraday's law is the flux that goes through the area bounded by the "amperian" curve.

The equations look very similar. Remember that in magnetism, we have never seen a magnetic charge, we will only see dipole. If there existed magnetic charges in the Universe and these charges were to move to create a "magnetic current", we would expect a term like <lrn-math>\mu_o I_{magnetic}  </lrn-math> on the right-hand side of Faraday's law. We have never seen such charges so it make sense that this terms is not there.

But what about the flux term? Faraday's law says that a changing magnetic flux creates an electric field. Could the reverse be true? Could a changing electric flux create a magnetic field. The answer is yes and Ampere's law need to be corrected to account for that possibility!
