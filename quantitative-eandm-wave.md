The derivation of the wave equation in sec 31.5 is fairly math heavy and non-essential. The results Eq 31.36-38 are the important takeaways.  Similarly, the beginning of section 31.7 is important but we will not use Malus's Law.

In the video below, Le and I illustrate a basic radio system.

Let me summarize the most important properties of the E&M wave

* It is a transverse wave of an oscillating E and B field. The E field and B field are perpendicular to the direction of motion of the wave. 
* The E and B fields are perpendicular to one another
* The E and B fields are in phase (they max out at the same time). 
* The amplitude of E and B are related by <lrn-math> E=cB </lrn-math>
* The speed of the E&M wave in vacuum is <lrn-math>c=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_0\mu_0} 299792458 m/s approx 3\times 10^8 m/s</lrn-math>
