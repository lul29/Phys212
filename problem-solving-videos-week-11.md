## Magnetic Forces and Torques

The 10-turn loop of wire shown in the figure below lies in a horizontal plane, parallel to a uniform horizontal magnetic field, and carries a 2.0 A current. The loop is free to rotate about a nonmagnetic axle through the center. A 50 g mass hangs from one edge of the loop. What magnetic field strength will prevent the loop from rotating about the axle?

## Induction


Youâ€™ve decided to make the magnetic projectile launcher shown in the figure for your science project. An aluminum bar of length l slides along metal rails through a magnetic field B. The switch closes at t=0 s, while the bar is at rest, and a battery of emf <lrn-math>E_{bat} </lrn-math> starts a current flowing around the loop. The battery has internal resistance r. The resistances of the rails and the bar are effectively zero.
