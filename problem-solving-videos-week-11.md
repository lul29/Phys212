You’ve decided to make the magnetic projectile launcher shown in the figure for your science project. An aluminum bar of length l slides along metal rails through a magnetic field B. The switch closes at t=0 s, while the bar is at rest, and a battery of emf <lrn-math>E_{bat} </lrn-math> starts a current flowing around the loop. The battery has internal resistance r. The resistances of the rails and the bar are effectively zero.
