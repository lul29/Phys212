### Cognitive Psychology. 

Lets us start with a bit of theory that underlies the best studying strategies. The fundamental goes back to cognitive psychology.

Wikipedia Definition: **Cognitive psychology is the study of mental processes such as "attention, language use, memory, perception, problem solving, creativity, and thinking".**

The field of cognitive psychology had impacts in other fields such as economy, social psychology and more relevant for us educational psychology. 

Before 1950, the field of cognitive psychology was dominated by behaviorism which posit that mental processes were either reflexes or predictable given a person's history. 

During the second world war, there was much interest and research in improving the performance of soldiers. At around the same time, the first ideas of information theory, the computer and eventually artificial intelligence appeared. In combination with biological knowledge of where in the brain certain mental processes occur, this led to a revolution in cognitive psychology. Mental processes can be divided into parts, they can be studied and they can be improved. The brain is a muscle! 

From Wikipedia again, here is a definition of "cognition" by Ulric Neisser

> The term "cognition" refers to all processes by which the sensory input is transformed, reduced, elaborated, stored, recovered, and used.

Learning is very much part of cognition. So what have we learned about cognition that can improve soldier performance on the field or student's ability to learn? Quite a bit actually!

## Bloom's taxanomy 

Bloom's taxonomy is a way to organize cognitive knowledge in a hierarchy of different level of learning.

The idea is that there are many ways to know something. When someone says that they know something, what does that mean? Let us say my friend comes in and state that he knows about black holes

* do he just remember some stuff about them?
* do he understand the subject in a way that he could explain the broad features to me?
* Would he be able to apply his black hole knowledge to solve a problem involving two spinning Kerr black hole?
* Would he able to analyze and break down the theory surrounding black hole into its different parts: general relativity, thermodynamics, etc?
* Would he be able to tell whether the three last papers of Stephen Hawking are correct?
* would he be able to write a paper on black hole like Stephen Hawking did?

I am exaggerating with the last two. But you get the idea. Evaluating and creating are the highest level of learning.

### Question for you. 

* At what level of Bloom's do you think high-school students need to be to succeed in their exams?
* At what level of Bloom's do you think you need to aim to be to succeed in college?
