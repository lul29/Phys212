## Welcome to Phys 212, Electricity and Magnetism. 

In the previous course, we have discussed the fundamental physics of motion. How and why things move. 

The one sentence summary of the course is as follows. 

<lrndesign-sidenote label="Instructor Note" icon="bookmark" bg-color="#c2e5f2">
The motion of an object through space time is determined by the amount of energy and momentum it has. You can alter the motion by exchanging energy and momentum via impulses and/or work created by forces. Energy and momentum can never be created or destroyed, they can only be exchanged by forces.

In Phys 211, we discussed gravity as a long range force and many contact forces such 

* the normal 
* friction
* drag
* tension
* spring force. 

All of these contact forces are fundamentally caused by electric interactions of subatomic particles. 

The derivation from microscopic atoms to macroscopic properties of material is an interesting subject reserved for later physics courses.
