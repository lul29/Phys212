## Review Forces and Vectors. 

[video on review]



## Unit vectors. 

Here is a video review about vectors, particularly unit vectors and using components. 

A unit vector is a vector of length 1. They are use when we want to simply indicate the direction of a vector. 

For example the force of gravity we just saw could be written as 

<lrn-math>\vec{F}_{G} = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}\hat r </lrn-math>

where the <lrn-math>\hat r </lrn-math> is a unit vector along the straight line joining the two objects. 

Sometimes the unit vector will be obvious, sometimes you will need to calculate it by find a vector you know in that direction and divided by its length. 

<lrn-math>\hat r= \frac{\vec{r}}{r} <lrn-math>

Let me illustrate this procedure with the force of gravity and next week we will apply with the electric force (and later with the magnetic force).
