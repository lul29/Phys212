## Unit vectors. 

A unit vector is a vector of length 1. They are used when we need to indicate the direction of a physical vector quantities without changing its magnitude. 

For example the force of gravity we just saw can be written as 

<lrn-math>\vec{F}_{G} = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}\hat r </lrn-math>

where the <lrn-math>\hat r </lrn-math> is a unit vector along the straight line joining the two objects. 

Sometimes the unit vector will be obvious, sometimes you will need to calculate it by finding a vector you know in that direction and dividing by its length. 

<lrn-math>\hat r= \frac{\vec{r}}{r} </lrn-math>

Let me illustrate this procedure with the force of gravity and next week we will apply this with the electric force (and later with the magnetic force).
