and there was light. All of E&M can be summarized in the following 4 equations of

plus the Lorentz force on particle of charge q

<lrn-math>\vec{}F=q(\vec{E}+\vec{v}\times \vec{B}) </lrn-math>

We have not been calling it the Lorentz force but this is not new. It is the combined electric and magnetic on a particle of charge q moving with some velocity.
