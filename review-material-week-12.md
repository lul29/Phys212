Faraday's law is fairly all new but the second part of this week has many similarities with previous work we have seen so let me spelled those out. 

## Review of capacitor. 

Earlier in the class, we defined the capacitance of an object as 

<lrn-math> C = \frac{Q}{\Delta V_C} </lrn-math>

The capacitance turned out to depend only on the geometry of the object and it measure the ability to store charge for a given amount of potential needed. 

The most typical capacitor is the parallel plate capacitor (area A, distance d) with capacitance equal to 

<lrn-math>C=\frac{epsilon_0A}{d} </lrn-math>

In a circuit with a capacitor and a resistor

The capacitor will discharge. Using Kirchoff's loop law of conservation of energy, one finds that

<lrn-math>\Delta V_C +\Delta V_R = 0 </lrn-math>

<lrn-math> Q/C +R \frac{dQ}{dt} </lrn-math>

where we wrote the current as the rate of change of charge (the derivative). The solution, to this differential equation is 

<lrn-math> Q(t) = Q_0 e^{-t/\tau} </lrn-math>

with the time constant <lrn-math>\tau = RC </lrn-math>. Adding a battery to the circuit will lead to a new source term and we can now charge the capacitor. The resulting equation for charge and (for the potential on the capacitor) is fairly similar (see your formula sheet). 

<lrndesign-sidenote label="Instructor Note" icon="bookmark" bg-color="#c2e5f2">
The charge and potential can charge (increase) or discharge (decrease) in a RC circuit depending how you start. In either cases the current always decrease over time and the end current in a RC circuit is always zero (either the capacitor is empty or full). 
</lrndesign-sidenote>

To repeat, the current in a RC circuits always go like

<lrn-math> I = I_0 e^{-t\tau} </lrn-math> 

In the second part of this week we will introduce the "magnetic analog" of the capacitor, **the inductor** denoted L. We will discuss inductance and the the LR circuit. This circuit will have similar exponential decay of the current.

The final equations looks the same but the physics and the reasonings behind what is happening is very different.  
</lrndesign-sidenote>

## Simple Harmonic Oscillator. 

We will see the LC circuit (inductor + capacitor with no battery or resistance). This will turn out to oscillate back and forth like a mass on a spring. 

In a simple harmonic motion, the phase refers to the quantity inside the cosine.

<lrndesign-sidenote label="Instructor Note" icon="bookmark" bg-color="#c2e5f2">
In this course we will, by convention, always use cosine for simple harmonic motion even though you could use sine. 
</lrndesign-sidenote>

For example, the charge on a capacitor in a LC circuit will oscillate

<lrn-math>Q(t) = \cos\left(\phi\right) </lrn-math> 

The phase depends on time and can be written as 

<lrn-math> \phi = \omega t+\phi_0 </lrn-math>.

where </lrn-math> \omega = 2\pi f = 2\pi/T</lrn-math> is the angular frequency in rad/s. <lrn-math>\phi_0 </lrn-math> is the initial phase constant. The phase tells you where you are in the cycle the cosine. It is often easier to visualize the phase as an angular position on a fictitious circle.

The SHM is the x projection of the counter-clockwise circular motion
