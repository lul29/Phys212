## Motion of charges/dipoles in an electric field

Now that we can find the resulting electric field from a given charge distribution, we can study how other charges or dipoles will respond.

The idea is simple, the force on the charge is 

<lrn-math> \vec{F} = q\vec{E} </lrn-math>

If the charge is negative, the force is in the opposite direction to the electric field. 
</lrndesign-sidenote>

If the electric field is uniform (near an infinite plane of charge), the force will be constant and we can use our usual constant force and constant kinematics from Phys 211.

<lrn-math>\vec{F}=m\vec{a} </lrn-math>

<lrndesign-sidenote label="Instructor Note" icon="bookmark" bg-color="#c2e5f2">
If the force is perpendicular to the velocity, the charge will still accelerate, it will turn.  
</lrndesign-sidenote>

## Dipoles

The motion of a dipole is interesting. The opposite force on each end of the dipole create a torque that wants to alight the dipole in the direction of the E field. If the E field is uniform, the dipole will experience no net force. In an non-uniform field, there will be a small force.
