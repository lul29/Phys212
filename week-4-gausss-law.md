## Gauss' Law

Let me first explain a little bit why the readings for this week says to read but not study section 24.5.

In this chapter, we will see Gauss' Law which is one of the four most fundamental equations of electromagnetism (one of the famous Maxwell's equations). 

Gauss' Law is most often written 

<lrn-math>\Phi_e=\oint \vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{Q_in}{\epsilon_0} </lrn-math>

Now there is a lot to unpack in this mathematical formula. It is very abstract and involve multiple new concepts

* closed surface integral 
* differential area vector
* electric flux

We will go through these one at a time and I think that understanding at a conceptual level what this equation is and what it means is the most important part of this chapter. 

In section 24.5, you will see how Gauss' Law can be used to actually solved for the electric field. Unfortunately, due to the complexity of the surface integrals, few situations can be really done at the level of math we expect here. 

Most of the examples in section 24.5 are the situations we have already studied of the line of charge, the plane of charge, and the sphere. We already know all of these electric fields and they are on your formula sheet.
