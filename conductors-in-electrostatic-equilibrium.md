## Conductors in Electrostatic Equilibrium

To repeat, skim over 24.5 but don't spend too much on this. 

The last section is about conductor in electrostatic equilibrium. Really that means with no electric current!

The most important points here are (all derived from Gauss' Law)

* the electric field is zero inside the conductor. 
* the electric field at the surface is perpendicular to the surface. 
* the magnitude of the electric field at the surface is <lrn-math>E =\eta/epsilon_0 </lrn-math>where <lrn-math>\eta is the surface charge density of the conductor.
