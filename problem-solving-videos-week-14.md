Q1
A simple series circuit consists of a 150 Ω resistor, a 25 V battery, a switch, and a 2.5 pF parallel-plate capacitor (initially uncharged) with plates 5.0 mm apart. The switch is closed at t=0s.

a) After the switch is closed, find the maximum electric flux and the maximum displacement current through the capacitor.

b) Find the electric flux and the displacement current at t=0.50ns.

Q2 The figure below shows the electric field inside a cylinder of radius R=3.0mm. The field strength is increasing with time as <lrn-math> E=1.0\times10^8t^2 V/m</lrn-math>, where t is in s. The electric field outside the cylinder is always zero, and the field inside the cylinder was zero for t<0.

a) Find an expression for the electric flux through the entire cylinder as a function of time.

b) Draw a picture showing the magnetic field lines inside and outside the cylinder. Be sure to include arrowheads showing the field’s direction.

c) Find an expression for the magnetic field strength as a function of time at a distance r<R from the center.

d) Find an expression for the magnetic field strength as a function of time at a distance r>R from the center. Evaluate the magnetic field strength at r=4.0mm, t=2.0s.
