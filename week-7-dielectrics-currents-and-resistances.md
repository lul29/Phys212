## Week 7: Dielectrics, Currents and Resistances. 

If the capacitance of the Earth is 0.5 mF (as we saw last week). How can we engineer capacitors with C = 1 F or more? 

This week we move beyond electrostatic equilibrium and look at the movement of charges. We will introduce the last two important concepts needed to understand direct current circuits, current and resistance.
