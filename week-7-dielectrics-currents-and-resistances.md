## Week 7: Dielectrics, Currents and Resistances. 

If the capacitance of the Earth is 0.5 mF, how do we make 1 F capacitor?

What is an electric current? Why is current stronger in some substances versus others. 

This week we move beyond electrostatic equilibrium and look at the movement of charges. We will introduce the last two important concepts needed to understand direct current circuits, current and resistance.
