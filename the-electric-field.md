The electric field and gravitation field are very real and contain energy. By moving a charge to different position in the Universe, we will alter the electric field in the neighborhood of the charge.

### A vector field

There are many 'fields' in physics. One could think of the temperature in the room as a field. Each point in the room would have a temperature associated with it. THis is the same thing with the electric field, at each point in the room, there is a single value of the electric field. Unlike
