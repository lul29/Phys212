The idea of a field was one of the greatest discovery of physics. The idea is that instead of the action at a distance that Newton first invented, we now imagine that each object can alter a field that permeates space and the field is what cause other objects to feel a force (gravity or electric for example).

This is not just a trick. It turns out the electric field is a real entity that you cannot see with your eyes directly but that is everywhere in space. Think of it as a mattress that exists everywhere and on which things can occur.

The electric field and gravitational field are very real and contain energy. By moving a charge to different position in the Universe, we will alter the electric field in the neighborhood of the charge.

### A vector field

There are many 'fields' in physics. One could think of the temperature in the room as a field. Each point in the room would have a temperature associated with it. This is the same thing with the electric field, at each point in the room, there is a single value of the electric field. There is another important difference though, the electric field is a vector so at each point in space, there is 3 different numbers describing the electric field in the x, y and z direction.

We will represent the electric field by vectors arrows but there is no spatial extent! In the image below, the electric field arrow is the value of the electric field at the black dots. Between the dots, the electric field is not shown (and presumably unknown).

### So what is this good for?

Given a set of electric charge we will develop tools to calculate the electric field they generate around them. Once we know the electric field at everypoint in space created a by a charge configuration we can find the force that any test charge q would feel simply by

<lrn-math>\vec{E}(x,y,z) = \frac{\vec{F}_{on\;q} \;at\;(x,y,z)}{q}</lrn-math>


no units
