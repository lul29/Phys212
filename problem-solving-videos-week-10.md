## Problem Solving Videos Ampere's Law

*** I remind you that it is crucial that you try problem solving on your own. Just watching videos online is not enough for good learning. 

For example, do example 29.8 on your own and check your answer and method to the worked out solution by the author. 

Question: An infinitely wide flat sheet of charge flows out of the page in the figure below. The current per unit width along the sheet (amps per meter) is given by the linear current density Js.

a) What is the shape of the magnetic field? To answer this question, you may find it helpful to approximate the current sheet as many parallel, closely spaced current-carrying wires. Give your answer as a picture showing magnetic field vectors.

b) Find the magnetic field strength at distance d above or below the current sheet.

A particle of charge q and mass m moves in the uniform fields <lrn-math>\vec{E} = E_0\hat k </lrn-math> and <lrn-math>\vec{B}=B_0\hat k </lrn-math>. At t=0, the particle has velocity <lrn-math>\vec{v}=v_0\hat i. What is the particle’s speed at a later time t?
