## Review Dipoles, needed for torque on coil

When we discuss torque on coil of wires, we will make use of the magnetic dipole moment. 

For the electric dipole, we were able to define the dipole moment. 
<lrn-math> \vec{p} = (qs, \rm{from}\;+\;\rm{to}-) </lrn-math>

This has two uses. It tells us the orientation in space of the dipole and it also tells us its strength by encoding both the charge and their separation. 

In magnetism, the analog of the dipole is the current loop

In a similar fashion, we define the magnetic dipole moment as

One can go from E field to potential. The relationship is the same as what we learned in Phys 211 between force and potential energy. 

<lrn-math>\Delta V=-\int \vec{E}\cdot d\vec{s} </lrn-math>
