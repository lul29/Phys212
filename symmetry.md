First the concept of symmetry

Let us say we want to find the electric field surrounding a particle charge distribution. We can use the superposition principle by treating each part of the distribution has a point charge, use the electric field for a point charge which we know from Coulomb's law and then add each electric field. 

Great but before even doing all that we can tell a lot about the electric field by looking at symmetry of the charge distribution. We can tell the direction that the electric field must be in.
