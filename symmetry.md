## First the concept of symmetry

Let us say we want to find the electric field surrounding a particle charge distribution. We can use the superposition principle by treating each part of the distribution has a point charge, use the electric field for a point charge which we know from Coulomb's law and then add each electric field. 

Great but before even doing all that we can tell a lot about the electric field by looking at symmetry of the charge distribution. We can tell the direction that the electric field must be in. 

We have already use this notion of symmetry. In my problem solving video on example 23.3, I used a symmetry argument to say that the y component must be zero and that I did not need to calculate it. 


## The three most basics symmetry are planar, cylindrical and spherical. 

In the figure below from the book I added the equations from your formula sheet for the electric field. Each of these equations can be derived with the integral techniques of the previous chapter (using the superposition principle). It turns out that each of these can be derived in what many physicist will call a "cleaner" way using Gauss' law.
