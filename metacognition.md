## Shallow versus Deep Learning

Which of the following do you think is the MOST important ingredient for successful learning?

1. The intention and desire to learn
2. Paying close attention to the material as you
study
3. Learning in a way that matches your personal Learning Style?
4. The time you spend studying
5. What you think about while studying

To answer this question let us look at the following cognitive experiment. 24 words are read to a group of people, some of the participants are told to determine (in their heads) if the word contain an E or a G. Others are told to determine (in their heads) if they find the word pleasant or unpleasant. After the 24 words are read, each group has to recall as many words as they can. They all paid attention, they all tried hard but because of the instructions the participants were forced to do **shallow or deep processing of the words. **

Shallow processing is when the information is stored only in the working memory. Deep processing is a way to make connection to things in your long-term memory. As you might expect, learning with deep processing make things stick better.

Here are the results of the experiment. The "intentional" versus "incidental" refers to the fact that some students were told they would have to recall while other were not told about the future task. Surprisingly, being aware that you would be tested had little impact on the performance. The only things that mattered was whether the learning involved shallow or deep processing.

**What you are thinking when studying completely change how much you learn.** You internalize the information and achieve deeper processing by connecting the material to your emotions or previous experiences.

## How to achieve deep processing.

Just perusing the book with music on or doing problems quickly or googling is shallow processing and mostly a waste of your time. **It is better to spend less time but actually use that time to really process the information.**

As you study, ask yourself questions such as

- **Elaboration**: How does this concept relate to other concepts?
- **Distinctiveness**: How is this concept different from other concepts.
- **Personal**: How can I relate this to my personal experience? Stop yourself to think about that.
- **Appropriate to retrieval and application**: Ask yourself what you are expected to be able to do with the information.
