</stop-note>

This week we read all of Chap 28 except for RC circuits which we keep for next week. That means the circuits this week will only have resistors and batteries!

We now introduce various circuits symbols to be able to write circuit diagrams. It does require practice to go from an actual real circuit to a circuit diagram.

Notice how the lightbulb has 2 wires inside connected to two different outside metal conductors. As you should have discovered in your lab 3, a lightbulb has two ends like the other circuits elements we will learn in this class.

Section 28.2 has all the crucial information in Eq 28.1 and Eq 28.2 and tactics box 28.1.

The sign conventions for the change in potential across a battery and resistor are crucial to learn.

Section 28.3 define the notion of power of thermal energy dissipated in a resistor. The general formula is 

<lrn-math> P_R=I\Delta V_R </lrn-math> which just comes from taking the derivative with respect to time of the potential energy U=qV with dq/dt becomes the current. 

There are two reformulations of this equation using Ohm's law and both are important. 

<lrn-math> P_R = I^2 R=\frac{(\Delta V_R)^2}{R} </lrn-math>

The chapters then analyze, resistor in series, resistors in parallels, real batteries with internal resistance.

 This chapter explains how a voltmeter (such as the IOLab) is used in parallel and how it needs to have a high resistance in order not to disturb the circuit. A ammeter needs to be in series in the circuit and needs to have a small resistance. The compass is our ammeter (and it has a very small resistance!).

Section 27.7 introduces the case of multi-loop circuits where one needs to be more methodical. Look carefully at problem solving strategy 28.1 and the two worked out examples 28.9, 28.10. The idea is to use Kirchoff's two laws (Eq 28.1 and 28.2) for the whole circuit. Kirchoff's loop law applies to any loop in the circuits. You will get multiple equations (one for each loop) allowing you to solve for multiple unknowns.

We keep section 28.9 for next week while section 28.8 explains the concept of grounding.

### Doing the worked out example problems. 
 
 
For the more complicated examples, do not just read the solutions in the book right away. I recommend the following procedure.  

1. First, you read the example question ONLY.
2. You take a piece of paper and try to solve it, without looking at the solution. 
3. You may need to study the material, read the text before the example. Pay particular attention to problem solving strategies or tactic boxes. 
4. You may need to struggle, abandon one way and try another. This is good. This is learning. 
4. If you get the answer, compare just the solutions to the one in the book. If its the same, great, now look at what the author did. If its not the same, look back at your process first and try to find where you could have gone wrong. 
5. If after 2 attempts (say 1/2 hour at least), it does not work look at the solution provided by the author. You will need to try a similar problem again later to make sure you can do it without help.  


All the worked example in this chapter are worth doing with many of them being very simple (just one equation). Example 28.6 shows you why car battery are dangerous
