This week we read all of Chap 28 except for RC circuits which we keep for next week. That means the circuits this week will only have resistors and batteries!

Notice how the lightbulb has 2 wires inside connected to two different outside metal conductors. As you should have discovered in your lab 3, a lightbulb has two ends like the other circuits elements we will learn in this class.
