I am an associate teaching professor of physics and the director of online education in physics. I am originally from Québec in Canada. I did my PH.D at Cornell University and I worked at Texas A&M University and at the Perimeter Institute in Canada before coming to Penn State. My physics interests include cosmology and high-energy theory. 

I will introduce myself in more details on our first discussion board. I am looking forward to your introduction there as well!
