## Phase of simple harmonic oscillator. 

As a review to phasor, let us remember the trick we had to find the phase of a simple harmonic oscillator. 

In simple harmonic motion, the phase refers to the quantity inside the cosine.

<lrn-math>x(t) = \cos\left(\phi\right) </lrn-math> 

The phase depends on time and can be written as 

<lrn-math> \phi = \omega t+\phi_0 </lrn-math>.

The phase tells you where you are on the sine and cosine but it is often easier to visualize the phase as an angular position on a fictitious circle.

The SHM is the x projection of the counter-clockwise circular motion
