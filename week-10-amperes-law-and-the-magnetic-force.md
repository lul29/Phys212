Just like we were able to reformulate Coulomb's Law in the more general form of Gauss' Law, it turns out that there is such a reformulation for magnetism too in the form of Ampère's law. 

Ampère's law will allow us a faster way to solve for the magnetic field if the physical situation has the proper symmetries. 

In the second part of the week, we will start our investigation of the magnetic force. As we will see, a charge in a uniform magnetic field undergoes circular motion!
