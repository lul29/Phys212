And then Maxwell said, there was light. 

We will conclude this course (next week) by looking at how the equations for electromagnetism prove the existence of an electromagnetic wave. 

Before we do that it turns out that we have to fix one of the field equations that we have seen. Ampere's law cannot be quite right. 

In the second part of the week we will learn about waves in general since this is really the first wave we see!
