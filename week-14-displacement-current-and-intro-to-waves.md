And then Maxwell said, let there be  light.

We will conclude this course (next week) by looking at how the equations for electromagnetism implies the existence of an electromagnetic wave.

Before we do that, we have to fix one of the field equations we have seen. It turns out that Ampere's law is missing something!

In the second part of the week we will learn about waves in general before we can tackle the E&M wave.
