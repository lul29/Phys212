This chapter starts with an introduction to magnetism with bar magnets. Bar magnet always have two poles a North and a South pole.

It is not easy to explain from first principles where the magnetism of natural bar magnets comes from. Historically, we really started to have a quantitative understanding of magnetism when it was discovered that wires with current in them produce magnetic fields. 

Fundamentally, it was discovered that a moving electric charge produces a magnetic field. So just as we have Coulomb's law for the electric field created by an electric charge, we now will have a new law, called Biot-Savard law that tells us the magnetic field created by an electric charge.

The Biot-Savard law can be written for point charge or for an electric current. There is a direct relation between the two.

### Biot-Savard Law

Let me write the two versions Biot-Savard law that we will use. These are eq. 29.4 and 29.6.

The magnetic field produced by a point charge is given by 

<lrn-math>
\vec{B}_{point\;charge}=\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\frac{q\vec{v}\cross\hat r}{r^2} </lrn-math>

while the magnetic field produced by a very short segment of wire with current I is 

<lrn-math>
\vec{B}_{current\;segment}=\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\frac{I\Delta\vec{s}\cross\hat r}{r^2} </lrn-math>

It is very worthwhile to do a compare/contrast Biot-Savard and Coulomb laws. There are multiple similaries
