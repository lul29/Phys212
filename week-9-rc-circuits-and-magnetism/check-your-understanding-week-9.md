This chapter starts with an introduction to magnetism from bar magnets to wire with current in them. Here is a short intro video on bar magnets

It is not easy to explain from first principles where the magnetism of natural bar magnets comes from. Historically, we really started to have a quantitative understanding of magnetism when it was discovered that wires with current in them produce magnetic fields. 

Fundamentally, this is because moving electric charges produce magnetic fields. So just as we have Coulomb's law for the electric field created by an electric charge, we now will have a new law, called the Biot-Savard law, that tells us the magnetic field created by a moving electric charge.

The Biot-Savard law can be written for point charge or for an electric current. There is a direct relation between the two.

There is no analog of the electric charge in magnetism. There is no magnetic charge. Why? We don't know... we have just never seen one. All magnetism that we see in the Universe arises from the motion of electric charges.

### Biot-Savard Law

Let me write the two versions of Biot-Savard law that we will use. These are eq. 29.4 and 29.6.

The magnetic field produced by a point charge is given by 

<lrn-math>
\vec{B}_{point\;charge}=\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\frac{q\vec{v}\cross\hat r}{r^2} </lrn-math>

while the magnetic field produced by a very short segment of wire with current I is 

<lrn-math>
\vec{B}_{current\;segment}=\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\frac{I\Delta\vec{s}\cross\hat r}{r^2} </lrn-math>

It is very worthwhile to do a compare/contrast of Biot-Savard and Coulomb laws. 

* The SI unit of the magnetic field (denoted B) is the Tesla. 1 T is 1 Newton per ampere per meter. This is better than the electric field who was never given its own unit. Remember that we used alternatively Newton over Coulomb (N/C) or Volt over meter (V/m) for the unit of the E field.  
* We have a new fundamental constant of nature with magnetism called the permeability constant <lrn-math>\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7}\; T\;m/A </lrn-math>. Looks very similar, in name and notation, to the permittivity constant of electricity ( <lrn-math>\epsilon_0 </lrn-math>) but it appears in the numerator not the denominator.
* Both laws depends on the inverse squared of the distance, <lrn-math> 1/r^2 </lrn-math>.
* Coulomb's law only depends on the charge. Biot-Savard depends on the charge and on the velocity. The magnetic field is zero if the electric charge is not moving. 
* The direction is the most difficult part of the equation. The direction of Coulomb's law was radial <lrn-math> \hat r </lrn-math>. The direction of Biot-Savard law is given by the cross-product of velocity <lrn-math>\vec{v} </lrn-math> and <lrn-math> \hat r </lrn-math>. Or by the cross-product of the direction of the wire segment (in direction of current) and <lrn-math> \hat r </lrn-math>.

### Direction of magnetic field a

The subject of magnetism include multiple _different_ right-hand rule (RHR). It will be important to _compare and contrast_ the different rules as we go along. 

We already have two rules under our belt

* The right hand rule used in the cross-product (see review). I prefer to do this with my hand aligned with vector A, then reaching (closing) toward vector B (in the shortest angle). The cross-product is then in the direction of my thumb. 
* Tactics box 29.1 gives the rule to find the magnetic field around a wire carrying a current I. In this RHR, the thumb is in the direction of the current and the B field is in the direction of the closing right hand. The B field is circular in shape.

Note the difference. In one rule, the thumb is the result of the RHR while in the other rule, the resulting direction is given by the curling hand.
