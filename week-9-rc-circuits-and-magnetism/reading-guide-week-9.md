Discharging a capacitor is really a circuit with two components: a resistor and a capacitor. The resistor could be the equivalent resistor of a combination of resistors.  

The Kirchhoff loop equation for the circuit (eq 28.25) + definition of current as the derivative of charge (eq 28.6) lead to the equation

<lrn-math> \frac{dQ}{dt}+\frac{Q}{RC} </lrn-math>

and the solution to this is the exponential decay with time constant 

<lrn-math>\tau = RC </lrn-math>
