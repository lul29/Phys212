### Math Review Exponentials

RC circuits are described via the exponential function <lrn-math>e^{-t/\tau} </lrn-math>. This is exponential decay as a function of time. The variable (time) is in the exponential and the physical quantity starts at some value often described as <lrn-math>A_0 </lrn-math> and decreases very quickly, but asymptotically to zero. For example here a capacitor with initial charge <lrn-math>Q_0 </lrn-math> will discharge when connected to a resistor R as 

<lrn-math>Q(t)=Q_0e^{-t/tau}


The constant <lrn-math>\tau </lrn-math> has units of time. It is called the time constant of the circuit.

This will come back in multiple context in this class. Whenever a circuit element is discharging, we get exponential decay.

While it is possible to have exponential growth <lrn-math>e^{+t/\tau} </lrn-math> in physics, it usually refers to physical phenomena getting "out of hand" or unbounded. In the case of a capacitor charging, the growth is not unbounded. The capacitor usually charges to a final voltage/charge asymptotically. This is mathematically described as <lrn-math> 1-e^{-t/\tau} </lrn-math>.

You may want to review Chap 15 on oscillations. The damped oscillator had an amplitude that was described by an exponential decay.

### Math Review the vector cross-product. 

In the second part of this week's material, we study Biot-Savard law which involves the cross-product.
