### Math Review Exponentials

RC circuits are described via the exponential function <lrn-math>e^{-t/\tau} </lrn-math>. This is exponential decay as a function of time. The variable (time) is in the exponential and the physical quantity starts at some value often described as <lrn-math>A_0 </lrn-math> and decreases very quickly, but asymptotically to zero. For example here a capacitor with initial charge <lrn-math>Q_0 </lrn-math> will discharge when connected to a resistor R as 

<lrn-math>Q(t)=Q_0e^{-t/tau} </lrn-math>

The constant <lrn-math>\tau </lrn-math> has units of time. It is called the time constant of the circuit.

This will come back in multiple context in this class. Whenever a circuit element is discharging, we get exponential decay.

While it is possible to have exponential growth <lrn-math>e^{+t/\tau} </lrn-math> in physics, it usually refers to physical phenomena getting "out of hand" or unbounded. In the case of a capacitor charging, the growth is not unbounded. The capacitor usually charges to a final voltage/charge asymptotically. This is mathematically described as <lrn-math> 1-e^{-t/\tau} </lrn-math>. For example, charging of a capacitor is given by 

<lrn-math> Q(t)=Q_0\left(1-e^{-t/tau}\right) </lrn-math>

You may want to review Chap 15 on oscillations. The damped oscillator had an amplitude that was described by an exponential decay.

### Math Review the vector cross-product. 

In the second part of this week's material, we study Biot-Savard law which involves the cross-product. 

The first time we saw the cross-product was in Phys 211 when we introduced the notion of torque. Review section 12.10 of the Knight book on cross-product. 

When applied to torque the cross-product is 

 <lrn-math>\vec{\tau}=\vec{r}\times\vec{F} </lrn-math>
 
 The magnitude of this product is what we have been using up to now <lrn-math>|\tau| =rF\sin\theta </lrn-math> where the angle is the angle between the two vectors. The direction is given by a new right-hand rule. The order is important for the cross product and the direction is given by the right-hand rule. There are two ways to do the right-hand rule. I prefer the second (to the right) in this image.

Make sure you differentiate the dot product (whose result is a number) from the cross product which results in a vector.
