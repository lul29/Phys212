The most fundamental magnetic field configuration that we will work with are summarize on the formula sheet.

The first two on the left are the fundamental equations (discovered experimentally). This is Biot-Savard law expressed for a moving point charge or for a current (an ensemble of moving point charges). 

All the other equations can be derived from Biot-Savard by using the current segment equation and summing over many currents.
