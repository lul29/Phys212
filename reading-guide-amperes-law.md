The most fundamental magnetic field configuration that we will work with are summarize on the formula sheet.

The first two on the left are the fundamental equations (discovered experimentally). This is Biot-Savard law expressed for a moving point charge or for a current (an ensemble of moving point charges).

All the other equations can be derived from Biot-Savard by using the current segment equation and summing over many currents.

One important field configuration which is not including in the formula sheet is the magnetic dipole (sec 29.5). This is the bar magnet that Chap 29 started with but it turns out to also be the magnetic field of a current loop.

The concept behind the magnetic dipole is just as important as when we discussed the electric dipole (in particular the <lrn-math>1/r^3 </lrn-math> dependence at large distances).

Look carefully at example 29.7. The magnetic dipole moment will come back.

### Ampere's Law

The first part of section 29.6 is about line integral which I reviewed briefly in the last section.

Look carefully at tactics box 29.3. All line integrals in this course will be either constant B over the path or 0 (perpendicular B).

Ampere's law is one of the Maxwell equation

<lrn-math>\oint \vec{B}\cdot d\vec{l} = \mu_0 I_{through} <lrn-math>

Some notes
* The "amperian" path is an arbitrary closed curve. You can choose it however you want.
* The current has to pierce through the surface delimited by the closed curve.
* Ampere's law can be shown to follow from Biot-Savard but it turns to be a more general form.
* There is no real derivation of this or Biot-Savard. You should think of this as a fundamental law of nature that was discovered via experimental evidence.

Note the similarities and differences with Gauss' Law. Gauss'law involve a close surface while Ampere's law involves closed curve. Note that the only the current going through the curve matters. Any outside current will lead to contribution that cancels. The shape and position of the Amperian curve does not matter (just like it did not matter for the Gaussian surfaces.

We will practice multiple examples of Amperes' law in this course but as usual, start with the worked out examples in the book, 29.8 and 29.9
