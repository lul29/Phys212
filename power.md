The idea is still that P = iv (using instantaneous values) but we are not really interested in the instantaneous value but rather the average over time. 

Read carefully section 32.6, the upshot is

* the average power (average over time) on the capacitor and inductor are zero. Sometime, they deliver energy, sometime they absorb it.
* the average power is all on the resistor and it is equal to 

<lrn-math> P_{source} = I_{rms}\mathcal{E}_{rms}cos\phi </lrn-math>

Max power is obtained at resonance when the phase angle is zero.
