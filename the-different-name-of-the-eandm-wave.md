## Qualitative Overview. 

Before we go into the details of the E&M wave, let me give you an overview of the subject from a qualitative and conceptual perspective .

You will remember that electric charges are producing electric fields everywhere in space, and these electric fields are what cause the electric force of repulsion and attraction between charges. We also saw that if the electric field (E) is changing (for example, if an electron is moving in a current), it creates a magnetic field B.

## The Electromagnetic Wave

As you might have guessed already, this back and forth—E creates a back-and forth B which then creates E— which... can go on indefinitely in the form of a traveling wave as shown below. A changing E field induces a changing B field. This back and forth is a wave, known as light!

Electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light with the usual relation of wavelength and frequency:

<lrn-math>c = \lambda f</lrn-math>

where c stands for the speed of light.

## Amplitude, Power and Intensity

Just like any other wave, the electromagnetic wave has, in addition to a wavelength and frequency, an amplitude (A) which is proportional to the max E or B field. The bigger the amplitude, the more energy and momentum it carries.

Instead of talking about the amplitude of the wave, we often talk about the intensity of a wave I. This is the average energy transferred over a certain area. This is averaged over one cycle of oscillation. The intensity can be written as the power (energy per time) divided by the area

<lrn-math> I = \frac {\rm{Power}}{\rm{Area}} </lrn-math>

if you double the amplitude of a wave, the amount of energy per second per unit of area will quadruple.

<lrn-math> Intensity \propto \rm{Amplitude}^2</lrn-math> 

The unit of intensity is Watts per meter squared <lrn-math>W/m^2</lrn-math>

The discovery of the electromagnetic wave by James Clerk Maxwell in 1861 cannot be overstated as an achievement in humankind's search for answers. In one stroke, Maxwell finalized our understanding of the electromagnetic theory, set the stage for Einstein to discover relativity, and discovered that the speed of the electromagnetic wave was exactly the speed of light, leading to the obvious connection that light itself is an electromagnetic wave.

## One Wave with Many Names 

Creating an electromagnetic wave is fairly easy, you just shake back and forth some electrons (this is what an antenna does). If you shake faster, you will generate a higher frequency wave.

In a radio antenna, we shake the electron at a frequency of <lrn-math>10^4</lrn-math> Hz. This is 10,000 cycles per second! And this is the low frequency range! If you shake the electron with a frequency of <lrn-math>10^{12}</lrn-math> Hz, you will get infrared light while <lrn-math>10^{15}</lrn-math> Hz is the frequency of visible light.

For each corresponding frequency, we can find the corresponding wavelength <lrn-math>\lambda = c/f</lrn-math>. For radio, the wavelength is about 1 km while for visible light it is about <lrn-math>0.5\mu m</lrn-math> (where <lrn-math>\mu m = 10^{-6}\; m</lrn-math>). Look at fig "spectrum" below to get an idea of the range of electromagnetic waves.

The figure show a range of frequency for electromagnetic waves. A small fraction of these frequencies is visible light. Other frequencies corresponds to waves which have different names like radio or microwave. 

The important thing to remember is that all of these seemingly different waves are really just one and the same type: the electromagnetic (E&M) wave.

## Color

Even in the small range of frequencies and wavelengths that we can detect, the visible spectrum, we can make further subdivision. Our eyes can detect the differences between a light wave of 600 nm versus 400 nm where (1 nm = 1 nanometer = <lrn-math>10^{-9}</lrn-math> m) and these differences are interpreted in our brain as different colors. Below is the spectrum of visible light:
