## Video on Learning

Stephen Chew is a cognitive psychologist at Samford University in Alabama. He has made a series of videos (6 total) on how to study smart not hard. These videos have been seen by millions and Professor Chew was named US national professor of the year in 2015. 

I **strongly recommend** watching those videos. You do not need to watch them all in one sitting and the material in those videos is not covered in the exams per se but there are many useful tips to take with you. 

Here is the summary video for the series. The word "fail" in the title here refers to not getting a passing grade.
