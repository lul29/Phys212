## Problem Solving Videos Week 8


Let me illustrate the material of this week in the following two problems. 

Bulbs A and B in the figure are identical, and both are glowing. Bulb B is removed from its socket. Does the potential difference <lrn-math>\Delta V_{12} </lrn-math> between points 1 and 2 increase, stay the same, decrease, or become zero? Explain.

## Multiloop with multiple batteries. 

Let us calculate the rate at which each of the three batteries in the figure either delivers or absorbs (specify which in each case) energy. Assume all the batteries have zero internal resistance, and use numerical values <lrn-math>R_1=R_3=1.0\;\Omega,\;R_2 = 2.0\;\Omega,\;\mathcal{E}_1 = 2.0\;V </lrn-math> and <lrn-math>\mathcal{E}_2 = \mathcal{E}_3 = 4.0\;V </lrn-math>
