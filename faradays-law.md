Before we move on to applications of electromagnetic induction, we need to understand more the basic idea we first heard about last week about induction. 

There are three components to understand 

* **The direction of induced current/emf/E field**. The essential idea is encapsulated into Lenz's law. Essentially, the system is trying to oppose the change in magnetic field and counteract it. 
* The magnitude of the induced EMF. This is Faraday's law and there we can be quantitative using magnetic flux as defined last week. 
* Then finally we can go more abstract and write Faraday's law in terms of electric field and it then looks very similar to Ampere's law and it can be used in similar ways. 

In the following two videos I discussed induced EMF
