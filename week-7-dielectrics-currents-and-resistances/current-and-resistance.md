Read the whole chapter but we will not use the model of conduction of section 27.2 very much in this course. 

**Example 27.1-27.3 do not need to be done

### The Electron current

What you should know from section 27.1-27.2 are

* In metals, electrons are the charge carrier while the protons do not move. 
* Electrons move very fast but in random directions. It is like a gas (or a sea) of bouncing particles. The current is due to a drift of the gas and the actual drift speed is fairly small like 0.1 mm/s. 
* A current is created by an electric field **inside** the conducting wire. This electric field is created by non-uniform distribution of charge. The electric field points from the + to the - of the battery.

The direction of the current is traditionally defined as the direction of the electric field so from + to -. The electron current is actually in the opposite direction as the electric field!

## Conventional current

Section 27.3-27.5 then define 3 basics concepts 

* the conventional current denoted <lrn-math> I </lrn-math>: It is just the rate of change of charge per unit of time, eq 27.9. 
* the current density J which is just current per area. 
* Conductivity and resistivity. These measure how good of a conductor a metal is. Relation 27.17 is the key, <lrn-math>J=\sigma E </lrn-math>.  A good conductor has a good conductivity which means that for a given E field, it will have a bigger current density. 

<lrndesign-sidenote label="Instructor Note" icon="bookmark" bg-color="#c2e5f2">
Again all the formulas relating current to drift speed and electron density are not so important since they involve the model of conduction of section 27.2 that we are not emphasizing in this course. You do not need to do Example 27.4.
</lrndesign-sidenote>

Finally the chapter ends with Ohm's law which is important. By relating the E field to potential and using relation <lrn-math>J=\sigma E </lrn-math> one find Ohm's law

<lrn-math> \Delta V = I R </lrn-math>

This is the potential difference because potential itself is meaningless (we can redefine the zero) and the resistance R only depends on the property of the material. 

<lrn-math> 
R =\frac{\rho L}{A}
</lrn-math>

<lrndesign-sidenote label="Instructor Note" icon="bookmark" bg-color="#c2e5f2">
Ohm's law is a model. It is not always obeyed, it assumes <lrn-math>J=\sigma E </lrn-math> which is not always true (this was for this particular model of conduction). 
</lrndesign-sidenote>

### Battery as a source of potential. 

The chapter end with an important point that batteries are not constant source of current. They are constant source of potential. A 1.5 V battery always output 1.5 V. The current that is pulled from the battery will depend on the resistance of the circuit. 

<lrndesign-sidenote label="Instructor Note" icon="bookmark" bg-color="#c2e5f2">
A battery can deliver more or less current but always the same potential difference.
