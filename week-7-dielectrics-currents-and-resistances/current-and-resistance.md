Read the whole chapter but we will not use the model of conduction of section 27.2 very much in this course. 

What you should know from section 27.1-27.2 are

* In metals, electrons are the charge carrier while the protons do not move. 
* Electrons move very fast but in random directions. Its like a gas of bouncing particles. The current is due to a driftThe actual speed of the current is electron drift more than move in a straight line. The electrons move very fast
