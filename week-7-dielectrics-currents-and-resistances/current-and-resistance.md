Read the whole chapter but we will not use the model of conduction of section 27.2 very much in this course. 

**Example 27.1-27.3 do not need to be done

What you should know from section 27.1-27.2 are

* In metals, electrons are the charge carrier while the protons do not move. 
* Electrons move very fast but in random directions. It is like a gas of bouncing particles. The current is due to a drift of the gas and the actual drift speed is fairly small like 0.1 mm/s. 
* A current is created by an electric field **inside** the conducting wire. This electric field is created by non-uniform distribution of charge. The electric field points from the + to the - of the battery.

The direction of the current is traditionally defined as the direction of the electric field so from + to -. The electron current is actually in the opposite direction as the electric field!
