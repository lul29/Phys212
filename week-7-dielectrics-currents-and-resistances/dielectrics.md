## Dielectrics


A dielectric is material that can be polarized in the presence of an electric field. The polarization creates a new electric field (E induced) that is in the opposite direction of the original. The electric field inside of a dieletric has thus two components (hence the name).

This is useful because 

* by reducing the E field, we reduce the voltage difference which increase the capacitance. You can store more charge in a capacitor if you can reduce the E field for a given charge. 
* every material has a max E field they can support before the atoms break and a spark is created. Perfect vacuum is a perfect insulator that would never break but air is far from perfect and many dielectric have a higher breaking point than air. 

Mathematically, dielectrics are described by the dieletric constant where 

<lrn-math>\kappa = \frac{E_0}{E} </lrn-math>

where the 0 refers to the vacuum electric field. The capacitance is increase by and the capacitance
