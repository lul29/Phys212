This section will take a little while to understand. Conceptually, there is a lot going on here so let us go slowly. The two worked out examples are simple but should help with the basics concepts. 

## Important points. 

A dielectric is a material that can be polarized in the presence of an electric field. The polarization creates a new electric field (E induced) that is in the opposite direction of the original. The electric field inside of a dielectric has thus two components (hence the name).

This is useful because 

* by reducing the E field, we reduce the voltage difference which then increase the capacitance. In other words, you can store more charge in a capacitor if you can reduce the E field for a given charge. 
* every material has a max E field they can support before the atoms break and a spark is created. Perfect vacuum is a perfect insulator that would never break but air is far from perfect and many dielectric have a higher breaking point than air. 

Mathematically, dielectrics are described by the dielectric constant where 

<lrn-math>\kappa = \frac{E_0}{E} </lrn-math>

where the 0 refers to the vacuum electric field. The capacitance is increased by this factor <lrn-math> \kappa </lrn-math>.
