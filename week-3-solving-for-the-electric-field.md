## Solving for the electric field. 

The electric field of a continuous distribution of charges can be obtained by dividing the objects into small bits of charge dq. Each infinitesimal charge produces an electric field

<lrn-math> d\vec{E} = k\frac{dq}{r^2}\hat r </lrn-math>

and the resulting electric field is the integral over the whole charge object.

The electric field is a vector so there is in principal three integrals to do in order to find each components <lrn-math>E_x, E_y, E_z </lrn-math>. An important piece of the work i to find how the unit vector <lrn-math>\hat r </lrn-math> depends on coordinates

To perform the integral, one must convert the charge dq into either a line element (dx, dy, <lrn-math> Rd\theta </lrn-math> etc) or an area element such as (dxdy or <lrn-math> rdrd\theta </lrn-math>.

This conversion is one of the crucial step and one must use the linear charge density <lrn-math>\lambda </lrn-math> or the surface charge density <lrn-math>\eta </lrn-math>.

Reading guide: These two sections are heavy on mathematics. This may be the highest level of calculus you may have done in a physics class up to now. Look at my problem solving video where I do example 23.3 in the book. Make sure you understand example 23.4. You should understand the steps in "a disk of charge" but I would not necessarily expect you all to be able to do the integral 23.23 in an exam.
