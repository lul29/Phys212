The book start by discussing electric potential energy. It is now time to review yet another important concept from Phys 211, energy, and we will apply it to this new electric force. 

## Important Energy Concepts quick review (see chap 9, 10)

* When talking about energy, you always need to define a system and an environment. You, the problem solver, decide what is "in" the system and what is "out" of the system. 
* Kinetic energy is the energy related to motion. 
* Work is a transfer of energy due to mechanical forces from the environment to the system. **Our convention is energy going in the system is POSITIVE work while energy going out of the system is NEGATIVE work**.
* Work is defined as the integral of the force along the motion over the distance that the force is applied. 
* For conservative forces, the work done by the force from point A to point B does not depend on the path taken between these two points. Conversely, the work done by a conservative along a closed path is zero. 
* Since all the work done by a conservative force can be "gotten back" by undoing the motion, we can define a potential energy U related to the force that has a value at each point in space. 
* The potential energy is defined as the negative of the work done by the force. 
* Potential energy is an energy of the whole system. If the force is external to the system (because of the way you defined the system) you must use the concept of work not potential energy.
* Non-conservative forces (such as friction, drag) within the system do not have potential energy. Instead they lead to an increase in the thermal energy of the system.

### Review of Energy bar Charts. 

The idea behind the bar charts is to think in terms of bank accounts as energy going from one form to the other. These diagrams are much more useful than you may think and are really worth the extra couple seconds that it requires to draw them when solving problems.
