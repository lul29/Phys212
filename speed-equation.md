## The speed of a Wave

Starting from

1. wavelength <lrn-math>\lambda</lrn-math> = (distance)/(oscillation): The wavelength is the distance traveled per oscillation or cycle.
2. Frequency f = (Oscillation)/(time): The frequency is the number of oscillation you do per unit of time. (usually in Hz so per second).

one gets:

(Wavelength)(frequency) = (distance)/(time) = speed v

or speed of wave <lrn-math>v = \lambda f</lrn-math>. There is a subtle point here that the speed v is determined by the medium. The speed is usually constant. The wavelength and frequency are the things that adjust themselves such that the product always equals v.
