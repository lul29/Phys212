## Electromagnetic Induction

The figure shows a 4.0-cm-diameter loop with resistance 0.10 Î© around a 2.0-cm-diameter solenoid. The solenoid is 10 cm long, has 100 turns, and carries the current shown in the graph. A positive current is cw when seen from the left. 

Find the induced EMF, the induced electric field and induced current in the loop at (a) t=0.5 s and (b) t=1.5 s.

## Inductor circuits

An LC circuit is built with a 20 mH inductor and an 8.0 pF capacitor. The capacitor voltage has its maximum value of 25 V at t=0 s.

a) How long is it until the capacitor is first fully discharged?
b) What is the inductor current at that time?
