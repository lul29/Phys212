## Electromagnetic Induction

The figure shows a 4.0-cm-diameter loop with resistance 0.10 Î© around a 2.0-cm-diameter solenoid. The solenoid is 10 cm long, has 100 turns, and carries the current shown in the graph. A positive current is cw when seen from the left. 

Find the induced EMF, the induced electric field and induced current in the loop at (a) t=0.5 s and (b) t=1.5 s.

## Inductor circuits

A 3.6 mH inductor with negligible resistance has a 1.0 A current through it. The current starts to increase at t=0 s, creating a constant 5.0 mV voltage across the inductor. How much charge passes through the inductor between t=0 s and t=5.0 s?
