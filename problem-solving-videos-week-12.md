## Electromagnetic Induction

The figure shows a 4.0-cm-diameter loop with resistance 0.10 Ω around a 2.0-cm-diameter solenoid. The solenoid is 10 cm long, has 100 turns, and carries the current shown in the graph. A positive current is cw when seen from the left. 

Find the induced EMF, the induced electric field and induced current in the loop at (a) t=0.5 s and (b) t=1.5 s.

## Inductor circuits

The switch in has been open for a long time. It is closed at t=0 s. What is the current through the 20 Ω resistor?
