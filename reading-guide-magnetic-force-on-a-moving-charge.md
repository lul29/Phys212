We have seen the various ways moving charges and current can create magnetic fields. But what do magnetic fields do? How do charges react in a magnetic field?

It turns out that just as moving charges produce magnetic field, conversely magnetic fields exert a force on moving charges. 

We can see directly in a Crookes' tube.
