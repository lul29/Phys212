Q1 At one instant, the electric and magnetic fields at one point of an electromagnetic wave are <lrn-math>\vec{E} = (200\hat\imath+300\hat\jmath-50\hat k)\;V/m </lrn-math> and <lrn-math>\vec{B} = B_0(7.3\hat\imath - 7.3\hat\jmath+a\hat k)\;\mu T </lrn-math>

a) What are the values of a and <lrn-math>B_0 </lrn-math>?

b) What is the Poynting vector at this time and position?
