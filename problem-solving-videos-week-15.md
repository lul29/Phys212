Q1 At one instant, the electric and magnetic fields at one point of an electromagnetic wave are <lrn-math>\vec{E} = (200\hat\imath+300\hat\jmath-50\hat k)\;V/m </lrn-math> and <lrn-math>\vec{B} = B_0(7.3\hat\imath - 7.3\hat\jmath+a\hat k)\;\mu T </lrn-math>

a) What are the values of a and <lrn-math>B_0 </lrn-math>?

b) What is the Poynting vector at this time and position?

Q2 In reading the instruction manual that came with your garage-door opener, you see that the transmitter unit in your car produces a 250 mW, 350 MHz signal and that the receiver unit is supposed to respond to a radio wave at this frequency if the electric field amplitude exceeds 0.10 V/m. You wonder if this is really true. To find out, you put fresh batteries in the transmitter and start walking away from your garage while opening and closing the door. Your garage door finally fails to respond when you’re 42 m away. What is the electric field amplitude at the receiver when it first fails?
