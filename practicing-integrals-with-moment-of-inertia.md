## Practicing Integrals with Moment of Inertia 

When there is a few point charges, we can just sum each electric field created by each point charge to get the total E field. In this class, we will also look at continuous charge distribution where the sum will be done via an integral. 

We have not done such integral in Phys 211 but we could have done so in the section about center of mass and moment of inertia. Before we tackle integrals involving the electric field, let us see how to do integral for rigid bodies. This is a review and extension of what we did in Phys 211.

The center of mass of a continuous distribution of mass is 

<lrn-math> x_{cm} = \frac{1}{M}\int_{over\;M} x dm </lrn-math>
and similarly for y and z coordinate. 

Two important things to note. 

* The integral must cover the whole object. You must think carefully to set up the right limit of integration. 
* the infinitesimal element of mass dm must be expressed in terms of coordinates. This is a crucial part of this type of problem. 

Similarly the moment of inertia is 

<lrn-math> I = \int_{over\;M} r^2 dm </lrn-math>

Make sure you look at examples 12.2 12.5 and 12.6. (as usual, if you have time, try them out without looking at solutions). If stuck, see my problem solving video below.
