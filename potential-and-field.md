The first part of Chap 6 is theoretical about the connections between potential and electric field. 

Essentially the electric field is the derivative over space of the potential while the potential is the integral of the electric field. Relations 26.3 and 26.9

Since the electric field is a vector and potential is a scalar, the relationship are actually a line integral of E yields V while the gradient of V yields E. As the book states, we will mostly do this graphically. 

* remember that you decide where the zero of potential is. For a point charge, choose the zero to be at infinity. 
* there is a minus sign in both expressions. 
* the E field points in direction of lower V, going down with equipotential surfaces. The E field is at 90 degree of the equipotential surfaces. 

### Conductors. 

In Week 4 we saw that 

* the electric field is zero inside the conductor. 
* the electric field at the surface is perpendicular to the surface. 

We now can add a few more statements regarding potential

* the whole conductor is an equipotential. 
* the E field goes like V/R for a conductor tip of size R. The electric field can become very intense and create corona discharge.
