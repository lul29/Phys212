## Coulomb's Law

In week 1 we reviewed quickly Newton theory of gravity where the force between two objects is given by 

<lrn-math>F_{G,1\;on\;2} = F_{G,2\;on\;1} = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2} </lrn-math> and the forces is directed along the the straight line joining the two objects. 

This is Newton's universal theory of gravity and the fundamental constant of Nature that determines the strength of the gravitational interaction is called the gravitational constant. 

<lrn-math>G= 6.67\times10^{-11}\;N\;m^2/kg^2 </lrn-math>

In 1785, Charles Coulomb published the results of difficult experiment which demonstrated that the electric force was also an inverse-square law force. 

Coulomb's law says that the force of two charge particles is 

<lrn-math>F_{1\;on\;2} = F_{2\;on\;1} = \frac{K|q_1||q_2|}{r^2} </lrn-math>

Where we take the magnitude of each charge to determine the strength of the force and where the electrostatic constant K is 

<lrn-math> K =8.99 \times 10^9\;N\;m^2/C^2 </lrn-math>

We almost never write Coulomb's law in terms of K, we use instead the permittivity constant 

<lrn-math>\epsilon_0 = 8.85\times 10^{-12}\; C^2/N\;m^2</lrn-math>

and Coulomb's law become

<lrn-math>F = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}{|q_1||q_2|}{r^2} </lrn-math>

C is the Coulomb which is the SI unit of charge. Interestingly this unit is defined in terms of electric current which we have not seen yet and maybe more interestingly, Coulomb did not even know what fundamentally charges were when he discovered the inverse-square law that bears his name. The electron was to be discovered in 1897, 100 years after Coulomb's law!

The fundamental unit of charge is denoted _e_ and it has been measured to be 

<lrn-math> e= 1.60\times 10^{-19} C </lrn-math> 

Which is a very small number!! A single electron has a charge of -_e_ while a proton has charge of _e_. 

1 Coulomb corresponds to a huge number of electrons/protons!!

### Review forces with Coulomb's Law. 

Here is another good review of Phys 211 material but now with the electric force thrown in the mix!

The problem: A magician wants to know whether it could  levitate a charge object of 1 kg by placing another negatively charged plastic support 20 cm up. He wants to charge by friction and you know that typical charges acquired by friction are of the order of <lrn-math>10^{-8}\;\rm{to}\;10^{-9} </lrn-math> C. Prove to him that he is out of his mind.
