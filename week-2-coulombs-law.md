## Coulomb's Law

In week 1 we reviewed quickly Newton theory of gravity where the force between two objects is given by 

<lrn-math>F_{G,1\;on\;2} = F_{G,2\;on\;1} = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2} </lrn-math> and the forces is directed along the the straight line joining the two objects. 

This is Newton's universal theory of gravity and the fundamental constant of Nature that determines the strength of the gravitational interaction is called the gravitation constant. 

<lrn-math>G= 6.67\times10^{-11}\;N\;m^2/kg^2 </lrn-math>
