### Regression line. 

The regression line is the "best fit" for the data. It assumes a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variable. The regression line interpolates between the data point and allows you to predict the dependent variable based on a value of the dependent variable.

<lrn-math>\rm{Dependent} = a + b\times \rm{Independent} </lrn-math>. 

The regression line data on StatKey give both the slope (b) and the intercept (a). Both are super important. 

We will use the correlation r as a measure of how good the fit is.

When looking for linear relationship we may have to choose different functions of the dependent or independent variable.

Let me illustrate how to use StatKey to measure correlation and do "best fit". In the video, I will test the relationship between the period of a mass on a spring and the spring constant of that spring. The relationship is
