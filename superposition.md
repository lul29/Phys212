## The Superposition Principle. 

We know the electric field of a point charge but what about a configuration where there are many point charges? 

Just like we add forces to find the net force. We must add electric field to find the net electric field. This is the principle of superposition.

Read carefully section 23.2 and do example 23.1. The electric field is a vector so you must express it in components before you can add all the vectors. Finally read carefully the section on dipole, this is important and will come back.

## Four models for electric field. 

In the image below, you can see the four most important models we will use for electric field. Next week we will learn how to derive these expressions and many more.

These 4 electric fields are so important that they are on your formula sheet.

## Electric Field Lines. 

Electric field lines are a graphical representation of the electric field near a configuration of charge.

Here is the vector field diagram for the electric field around a dipole

and here is the corresponding electric field lines diagram.

Finally for another example, here are the field lines for two positive charges.

 The field lines diagram are not just qualitative, the density if field lines measure the strength of the electric field (and indicates the direction). The number of field lines emanating from a charge is a measure of how strong that charge is. Here both point charges have equal number of lines going out of them. They have to be to equal charges.
