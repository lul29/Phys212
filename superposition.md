## The Superposition Principle. 

We know the electric field of a point charge but what about a configuration where there are many point charges? 

Just like we add forces to find the net force. We must add electric field to find the net electric field. This is the principle of superposition.

Read carefully section 23.2 and do example 23.1. The electric field is a vector so you must express it in components before you can add all the vectors. Finally read carefully the section on dipole, this is important and will come back.

## Four models for electric field. 

In the image below, you can see the four most important models we will use for electric field. Next week we will learn how to derive these expressions and many more.

These 4 electric fields are so important that they are on your formula sheet.
