## Math Review: The Line Integral. 

Line integral were first introduced in Chap 9 of your book when we discuss work. By then we had that the work done by a force was

<lrn-math> W = =\int_C \vec{F}\cdot d\vec{l} </lrn-math>

where C is the one dimensional path in space where the force is applied.

The trick to evaluate such integrals is as follows 

* Evaluate the dot product <lrn-math>\vec{F}\cdot d\vec{l} at each point along the path. This results in a scalar function which varies along the path. 	
* Express the resulting scalar as a function f(l)  dl with some limit of integration <lrn-math>l_1,\;l_2 </lrn-math> that covers the whole path from A to B. This is the crucial step. 
* Once written as a 1D definite integral, evaluate it.

Many quantities in physics turns out to not be dependent on the particular path you choose. We can then choose paths where the calculations is easier (where the dot product has the same value everywhere in the path. A path may be divided into two pieces for example, on some parts the integrand would be zero, while on the other, its constant.

If the integrand is constant (say equal to F), then you can take it out of the line integral and the integral is just the length of the line.
