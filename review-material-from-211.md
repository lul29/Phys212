## Review material

Again, let us start by reviewing the fundamental ideas we have already seen that will be needed this week.

The relationship from Phys 211 was that the potential energy associated with a conservative force is the negative of the work done by that force while it goes from some initial point i to some final point f

<lrn-math> \Delta U = - W(i\rightarrow f) = -\int_{s_i}^{s_f}\vec{F} \cdot d\vec{s} </lrn-math>

### Notes

* only the component of the force along the path matters. If the force is perpendicular to the path, the work is zero. 
* Potential energy depends on position, this formula gives the potential energy at position <lrn-math>s_f </lrn-math> - the potential energy at position <lrn-math> s_i </lrn-math>
