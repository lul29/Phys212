## Review material

Again, let us start by reviewing the fundamental ideas we have already seen that will be needed this week.

The relationship from Phys 211 was that the potential energy associated with a conservative force is the negative of the work done by that force while it goes from some initial point i to some final point f

<lrn-math> \Delta U = - W(i\rightarrow f) = -\int_{s_i}^{s_f}\vec{F} \cdot d\vec{s} </lrn-math>

### Notes

* only the component of the force along the path matters. If the force is perpendicular to the path, the work is zero. 
* Potential energy depends on position, the formula above gives the potential energy at position <lrn-math>s_f </lrn-math> - the potential energy at position <lrn-math> s_i </lrn-math>
* The electric force is conservative which means that the work will be the same for all paths between position i and position f.

The last part is important! You can choose the path when doing the integral so choose something that simplifies your life and make the integral easier.
