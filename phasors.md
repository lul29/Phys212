An AC circuit is a circuit powered by a source whose EMF alternate with time. Our convention will be to take a cosine. 

<lrn-math>\mathcal{E}=\mathcal{E}_0\cos(\omega t) </lrn-math>

where <lrn-math>\mathcal{E}_0 </lrn-math> is the peak value.

The average value of the potential of the course is zero. 

To do AC circuit correctly, one needs to be careful with notation, we will 

* lower case for instantaneous values 
* upper case for peak value. 

For example, the current on a resistor at any given time will be denoted <lrn-math> i_R </lrn-math>. That current could be zero it could be the max current (denoted <lrn-math> I_R </lrn-math>), it could be the max current but in opposite direction or anything in between. 

Capacitor and inductor voltage are related to the integral/derivative of the current. This has two main applications

* This changes the phase by <lrn-math>\pm \pi/2 </lrn-math> between their voltage and the current. The capacitor lag while the inductor lead the current. 
* The peak value of <lrn-math>V_C </lrn-math> and <lrn-math>V_L </lrn-math> **depends on angular frequency**. 

<lrndesign-sidenote label="Instructor Note" icon="bookmark" bg-color="#c2e5f2">
This dependence on the angular frequency allows to build circuits for low-pass and high pass filters. The idea there is that you measure the voltage of a circuit element and that voltage will be block (near zero) for low or high frequencies depending how you build the circuit.

Examples, 31.1-32.5 are all very good to practice.
