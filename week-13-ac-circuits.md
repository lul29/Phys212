The subject of AC circuit is vast and we will only scratch the surface.  I consider that the most important concepts we will learn this week are

* The difference between instantaneous value and peak value of voltage, particular using phasor. 
* The idea that peak voltage of C and L depends on frequency. This can be used to create low-pass and high-pass filters. 
* The RLC displays a phenomena called resonance. This is how a radio tuner works.
