## Review from last week particularly important this week. 
 
Last week, we studied the microscopic nature of current and resistance (Chap 27). We discuss how to create a current and how the current was from the motion of electrons (drift speed).

 The conventional current is from the positive to the negative of the power source while the actual current of electron is in the opposite direction!

Using a special model of conduction we determined that the voltage drop in a resistor obeys Ohms's law. 

<lrn-math> \Delta V =I R

<lrndesign-sidenote label="Instructor Note" icon="bookmark" bg-color="#c2e5f2">
The \Delta symbol is because this is a voltage change as you go around the resistor. We will very often assume ideal wires with zero resistance. So the voltage will only change when we get to special circuits components. There will be no changes in the wire themselves.

We also saw Kirchhoff's junction rule (Eq 27.14) that tells us that charge is conserved at a junction. So what comes in must come out. 

## Physics review for this week. 

This week we need to remember that electric potential energy is <lrn-math> U=qV </lrn-math> and power is 

<lrn-math>P=\frac{dU}{dt} </lrn-math>

Power is the rate of change of energy. (like speed is the rate of change of position). The unit of power is the Watt. 

## Math review for this week

algebra!! We will have to solve multiple equations with multiple unknown.
